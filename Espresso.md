AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that lets frontend web and mobile developers quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS

The main strength of Amplify is that it quickly lets you add things like Storage,
Authentication, Monitoring, and PubSub functionalities. 
You don’t need to know what Amplify is providing behind the scenes to add these functions. For example, if you decide to use something like Storage, you may be provided one or more components from many AWS Services without actually knowing about it.

### What’s included in AWS Amplify?
