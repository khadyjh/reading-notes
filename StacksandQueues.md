# Stacks and Queues
linear data structures consist of nodes eche node references the next Node 
but they worked in different ways 

for the **stake** it fellow the **concept** of :

**FILO**
**F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut

That means that the first node entered in the stake will the last node out of the stak(will be in the end of the stack)

**LIFO**
**L**ast **In** **F**irst **O**ut

That means that the last node entered in the stake will the first node out of the stak(will be in the top of the stack)

for the **queue** it fellow the **concept** of :

**FIFO**

**F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut

That means that the first node entered in the queue will be the first node out of the queue.


**LILO**
**L**ast **I**n **L**ast **O**ut

That means that the last node entered in the queue will be the last node out of the queue.


### operations :

**insertion in :**

stack method called push()

queue method called enqueue()

**removing in :**

stack method called pop()

queue method called dequeue()



**peek() in :**

stake return the top of the stack

queue return the front of the queue

**isEmpty** method to work to the both data structure as the same 
check if empty or not
