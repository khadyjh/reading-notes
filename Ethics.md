if you are a freelancer you should think twice before you accept any project 
and as a muslim developer you need to be more aware of what is good(halal) and what is wrong(haram)

## ethics of a self-driving car: Who decides who lives, dies?
it's really a big ethical decision to make in certain situation .
the self-driven car designed to save humans and reduce the road accident,
but in some situation it can't 
avoid that maybe some people will die let's imagine that It’s a bright, sunny day and you’re alone in your spanking new self-driving vehicle, sprinting along the two-lane Tunnel of Trees on M-119 high above Lake Michigan north of Harbor Springs. You’re sitting back, enjoying the view. You’re looking out through the trees, trying to get a glimpse of the crystal blue water below you, moving along at the 45-m.p.h. speed limit.

As you approach a rise in the road, heading south, a school bus appears, driving north, one driven by a human, and it veers sharply toward you. There is no time to stop safely, and no time for you to take control of the car.

Does the car:

- A. Swerve sharply into the trees, possibly killing you but possibly saving the bus and its occupants?
- B. Perform a sharp evasive maneuver around the bus and into the oncoming lane, possibly saving you, but sending the bus and its driver swerving into the trees, killing her and some of the children on board?

- C. Hit the bus, possibly killing you as well as the driver and kids on the bus?


some says the car should save its passenger despite others but that illegal because every one life is matter "to make a decision in favor of one person and against another.”
 
Sebastian Thrun, who founded Google’s self-driving car initiative, told Bloomberg that the cars will be designed to avoid accidents, but that “If it happens where there is a situation where a car couldn’t escape, it’ll go for the smaller thing.”

But what if the smaller thing is a child?

AdMob helps you monetize your mobile app through in-app advertising. Ads can be displayed in a number of formats and are seamlessly added to platform native UI components.

Before you can display ads within your app, you'll need to create an AdMob account and activate one or more ad unit IDs. This is a unique identifier for the places in your app where ads are displayed.

AdMob uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK which helps app developers gain insights about their users and maximize ad revenue. To do so, the default integration of the Mobile Ads SDK collects information such as device information.
