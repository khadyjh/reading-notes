# Trees

it non linear data structure consists of nodes, and it have root and leaf 



## binary tree 
when tree have only two child for each node it called binary tree 

there is special kind whare it  organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right. 

## K-ary Trees

tree can have more than two child to each node then it called k-ary tree 


## Traversals
to search in tree you have to loop through it , so there is different ways to loop through it  :

### Depth first traversal :

  where we go to the depth first then up , there is three order to traverse 
  - Pre-order: root >> left >> right

     where we go to the root node at first then to left node then the right node  
- In-order: left >> root >> right

    where we go to the left node at first then to root node then the right node
- Post-order: left >> right >> root

    where we go to the left node at first then to right node then the root node


## Breadth First
where wo go level by level from the the root to the leaf ( from left to the right )
