# Growth Mindset

one of the video talked about grit ,and how important it is 
In fact being gritty means that you will never stop if something struggles, you will always find a solution for the problems even if it is so hard and advanced for you.

***‘ grit is sticking with your future day in ,day out not just for the week, not just for the month but for years , and working  really  hard to make that future a reality  ’***

also it talked about getting out of comfortable zone in the code, to learn new ways  to do the things to advance the code to change how to think about problems 


***'When's the last time you had to really dig deep to solve a technical problem?'***

in the previous month in the prep course sometimes i had problems so i searched and tried again and again until i get the result i want so gitting in problems help you to improv 

***‘power of yet ’ PY : Carol Dweck***
