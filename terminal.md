## Terminal reading note 

The command line : is text based interface to the system, you can deal with it by typing the command and the result will be text too.

- you can type your command only when the prompt appear else you need to wait.
- if you typed command line then pressed enter you need to wait until it finish, then prompt will appear again. 
- for using it in windows you need to setup Linux environment 
 
 here is Example of command I learned :

 - pwd  => stand for Print Working Directory to make new directory
 - ls => List the contents of a directory.
 - cd => stand for Change Directories to change directory
 - file => git information about the type of the directory file 
 - ls -a => list all thing in the directory even the hidden one 
 - man (command) => get the manual page for the command which have the all information about the command 
 - man -k (search term ) => search for the item in all manual page 
 - mkdir => stand for make directory a new folder.
 - rmdir => stand for remove directory remove the folder 
 - touch => create new file 
 - cp => copy the directory or file 
 - mv => move file or directory and can be used to rename it 
 - rm => remove file 

 also the terminal have history so you can use the arrows up and down to git the command you typed before  , the lift and right for edit the command .
